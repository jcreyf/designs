## Flat electric wire clips

I have 8/3, 10/3 and 12/3 gauge, flat UF-B (underground feeder and branch-circuit) running on my property to feed all kinds of electrical devices like mini-splits, bandsaw and woodmill.  Those wires run against walls here and there and need to get fastened.  I didn't find good, strong fasteners that were big enough for these wires, so I decided to create my own fastener.
