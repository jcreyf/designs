## Dryer Outlet Vent Connector 

The vent outlet of my washer/dryer is connected with a flexible duct pipe to a magnetic ring.  That ring sits flush with the wall and allows for the washer/dryer to quickly and easily disconnect when needed.  
I have a vent that sits outside, on the other side of the wall.  
The magnet ring and the vent need to be connected with a pipe but they don't exactly match in diameter.  
Here, I made a very simple 3D print project to make them connect perfectly.
